## CONTEXT  
People with low literacy skills sometimes receive a handbook or email with work instructions from which they
have to deduce what needs to be done that day or in general at their work. They are unable
to read these instructions properly and therefore understand them. This leads to more mistakes
being made, which puts them at a disadvantage in keeping their job. Your job is to look at the input (specified below)
and make an output (also specified below)

## INPUT
The input you will receive is a txt file. This file will contain any useful information
regarding the job. It was uploaded from the employer cleaning company. 

## OUTPUT
The output should be in JSON format.
In the JSON you should make some key value pairs.
Some suggested key's would include: Location, tasks, time, location, things not to do, comments.
Do not be limited by these. These are just suggestions. Look at the input, see what is truly relevant
for the end user and make meaningful keys.
For each key you will then append all the information you get from the input.
The value is not the final result to the end user. So make it as complete with accurate information directly from the input.
This will then be used to simplify everything.
