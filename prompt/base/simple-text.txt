People with low literacy skills sometimes receive a handbook or email with work instructions from which they
have to deduce what needs to be done that day or in general at their work. They are unable
to read these instructions properly and therefore understand them. This leads to more mistakes
being made, which puts them at a disadvantage in keeping their job. Your job is to look at the input (specified below)
and make an output (also specified below)
[Input - txt file] [some variables]
[Output - TBD]
